Tiny utilities that I use frequently

anynotes.ahk: opens up Notepad++ (assuming it is installed in the default Windows 10 directory) when F24 is pressed. 
  You should probably remap some key to F24 for this.
  
goog.ahk: Searches selected text on google when ctrl+shift+c is pressed

quickdoc.ahk: When capslock+A is pressed, creates new text file on current Explorer directory

config.xml AND stylers.xml: files for text style and configuration for Notepad++, turns it into essentially Notepad with tabs and auto indentation. Great for using with anynotes.ahk.
