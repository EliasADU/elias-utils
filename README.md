Tiny utilities that I use frequently

anynotes.ahk: opens up Notepad++ (assuming it is in the start menu) when F24 is pressed. 
  You should probably remap some key to F24 for this.
  
goog.ahk: Searches selected text on google when ctrl+shift+c is pressed.

quickdoc.ahk: When capslock+A is pressed, creates new text file on current Explorer directory.

config.xml AND stylers.xml: files for text style and configuration for Notepad++, turns it into essentially Notepad with tabs and auto indentation. Great for using with anynotes.ahk.

.gitattributes: LFS settings for Unity projects, all that you need is to copy/paste this file at the root level.

CheckboardGlobalShader.shader AND CheckboardLocalShader.shader: Shaders to use with prototype-grid materials to make the texture tile automatically as an object is
  resized.

nice_foobar_theme.fth: Just a nice foobar theme, nothing special.
